### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite for me because it was when I learned what a palindrome was. It was also the first time I used another rext document for a code. Although, I had a bit of trouble when I was working on this specific part. I was able to get some help from my partners, and learned a lot from it.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 1 was another favorite of mine. This part of the lab was the first time my partner and I finished a complete part of the lab assignment during class time. This was also the first time I learned that the name for the calendar we used was a Julian Calendar. I just thought it was interesting.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was another favorite of mine. My partner and I struggled with this part of the lab for some time, we had the correct formatting. We just had to mess around with the numbers and variables to figure it out. I thought it was exciting when we were getting close to figuring out the right combinations for the for loops. This lab taught me a lot about for loops.
